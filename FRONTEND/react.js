//jsx is syntax extension  for js , lets u write html like stuff inside js file it actually calls a js create element function it always returns a single root element that is why we use react fragments <>
//className instead of class
//keys are used as identifier it assigns a unique id to stuff if it goes to backend/database 
//keys shouldn't be random 
//props are used to transfer data in react
