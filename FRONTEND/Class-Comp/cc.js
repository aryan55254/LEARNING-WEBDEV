//class basedc components
//u will se this in older codebases using react  bcoz before 2019 u couldn't add state in functional components which changed after hooks were introduced 


//lifecycle methods
//render() it runs on mount and update of a component , doesn't modify state of component , doesn't interact with the browser 
//componentDIdMount() runs after comp is mounted , good to do anything relaint on component liek fetch from api 
//useeffect combines all the lifecycle methods
